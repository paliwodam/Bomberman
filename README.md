## How to play?

1. The player on the upper left side of the screen moves with the W A S D keys and places the bomb with the Z key, while the player on the lower right side of the screen moves with the arrows and places the bomb with the M key.

2. Each player starts the game with one bomb, but their number may increase during the course of the game. After placing the bomb, the player has 3 seconds to move away, because the bomb explodes during this time. The bomb damages objects within one cell (all except walls and power-ups)

3. Each player has three lives, which he loses if he is in range of the bomb when it explodes. The player who loses all 3 lives loses the game.
